# IW6x-Menu-Base
# NOTE: I only included the bare necessities needed for you to create your own menus

This is a simple menu base for the iw6x client using their LUA scripting API. 

The folder is placed into ``iw6x/scripts/`` from the root directory of your IW6x game folder. 
For help with scripts you can see the Scripting API examples on the xLabs github wiki: https://github.com/XLabsProject/iw6x-client/wiki/Scripting
For a list of all scripting api functions, see here: https://github.com/XLabsProject/iw6x-client/blob/develop/src/client/game/scripting/function_tables.cpp

do not contact me for help with the menu or adjusting / adding things, I will not provide any help and will likely ignore you. 

# Lastly, DO NOT contact the xLabs developers / team about this menu, I am not nor is this project associated with the team..
